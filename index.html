            <p>The album was number one in the United Kingdom, selling 672,000 copies in its first week, making it the
                fastest-selling album by a male solo artist there and the highest opening behind Adele's 25 and Oasis'
                Be
                Here Now. It also topped the charts in 14 countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia.
                In
                April 2018, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named รท the best-selling album
                worldwide of the decade.[3] In October 2019 it was ranked the fifth best-selling album of the 21st
                century
                in the UK.</p>
            <p>All the tracks on the album reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart in the week of the album's
                release.
                The dominance of its tracks on the UK chart led to calls for change on how the single chart is
                compiled,[5]
                and the Official Charts Company then introduced new rules limiting tracks eligible for entry in the top
                100
                to three per the main artist, as well as adjusting the streams-to-sales ratio for older songs.[6] His
                fourth
                single from รท, "Perfect", reached number one in the US, Australia and the UK, where it became the
                Christmas
                number one of 2017.</p>
            <p>To promote the album, Sheeran embarked on a worldwide concert tour, entitled the รท Tour. Comprising 260
                shows, it started on 16 March 2017 and ended on 26 August 2019 with the last of four homecoming gigs in
                Ipswich, Suffolk. By August 2019 it had become the biggest, most attended, and highest-grossing tour of
                all
                time.[7]</p>
